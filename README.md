# arduino-100led-rgb-led-interavtive-table
My playground for creating interactive table.


Inspiration for this is: http://www.it-gecko.de/100pixel-rgb-led-tisch-interaktiv-touch.html

Will try to add as much information as i can from point of view on noob in electronics :D







##CHANGELOG


# 26.03.2015

 * Trying to create PCB and schema in Eagle (http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/freeware/) but it is to compilcated for beginer
 * I was told to try Fritzing (http://fritzing.org/home/) it's designed for Arduino and for for me now
   * Created first schema for "pixel" wish to solder 9 of them, to create 3x3 pixel table, only with RED LED there
   * Schematic avaliable in schematic/pixel/v0.0.1/
 * awsome first printend PCB for pixel ![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michalbagrowski/arduino-100led-rgb-led-interavtive-table/master/images/pixel_v0.0.1.jpg)
 * unfortunetaly do not have small enought drill to start solvering ;/


# Before 24.03.2015
